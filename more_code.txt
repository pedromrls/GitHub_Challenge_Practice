A six-year legal battle over gender discrimination between several members of the US women’s 
national soccer team (USWNT) and the sport’s governing body, US Soccer, ended in a $24 million 
settlement on Tuesday.
An additional $2 million will be placed into a fund for post-career endeavors and charity.
